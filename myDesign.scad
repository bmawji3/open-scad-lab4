/*Bilal Mawji
Section A07
                  
I worked on this assignment by myself using only
this course's resources as guides.*/

/*Please note, when I press F5, it shows the middle portion of the trophy (the two cylinders and the hull'ed circles). When I press F6, they disappear and don't show.*/

/*This object is a trophy for the 1st place winner of a ninja competition.*/

/*I originally wanted to make some pyramids (which make up the ninja star), but I lated added in multiple different objects and shaped it into a trophy.*/

/*It is made up of a base that a minkowski between a cube and a cylinder. I also added some rounded cylinders on the bottom to give it some fashion. The rounded cylinders are made up of cylinders, spheres and cubes. To make it able to stand properly on a base, the spheres are differenced from the cubes so that it's flat on the bottom, but still has a curved look. The spheres are unioned to the cylinders which are unioned to the minkowski base. The minkowski base also has some tiled cubes on the long sides to add some fasion to it. I used a for loop and if statement to space them out properly.*/

/*Above the base are two cylinders that support the next level. The level above the cylinders are hulls of two circles. I used a forr loop to iterate through and create the hulls of cirlces on top of the other with smaller radii.*/

/*Above this is a cube that holds the ninja star. The ninja star is one pyramid that was rotated on the z-axis, and the y-axis to create the shape it is. There is also a sphere attached to the top of each pyramid, with exception to the left and right sides which have two because of the way they were rotated.*/

/*Finally, there is an intersection of a cube and a cylinder (made into a cone) that forms the base for the number 1. The "1" is made up of cubes that are translated and rotated to form the correct shape.*/
